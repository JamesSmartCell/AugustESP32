# AugustESP32
Prototype ESP32 implementation for August smart lock.

This will become an interface library for the August smartlock, here is just a prototype that show the smartlock connection and toggles the lock open/closed.
The setup is configured for the new lower-power ESP32-C3, but you can uncomment the config for the default ESP32 if you use that instead
